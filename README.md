# Installation of dependencies

## bundler (recommended)

If you have bundler (`gem install bundler`), you can do this:

    bundle install

If you don't have bundler, then just make sure you have the gems `faye-websocket` and `eventmachine`.
    
# Usage

    ruby connector.rb config.yml

**Important: Make sure you have a config file that you can use. Use config-example as a base and create your own based on it.**
