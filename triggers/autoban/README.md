Here's what you need to get this function working:

  * The autoban password
  * Your `config.yml` file

If you don't know the autoban password, don't bother with this, just remove this file from your config for triggers or modify it to not use an online banlist.

If you do, add a config key to the bot's config called `autoban` and under it make a key called `pw` and make its value the password.
