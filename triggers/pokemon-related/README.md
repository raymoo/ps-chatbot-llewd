## rspd

This command can be used to find the speed of a pokemon in a random battle. Examples:

```
!rspd breloom
```

That was pretty easy.

## rmon

This command can be used to generate a list of random pokemon (note, only one query is allowed per 3 seconds)

Examples:

```
!rmon
!rmon OU
!rmon 3
!rmon 3, OU
```
